1. Discovery Server Registry -->
        there maybe multiple instances of inventory service , and we dont know where to search for a service
        so we use "discovery server register" where we store where we can find a service.

        order service----> discovery server for ip of the inventory service, which discovery service will return
        snd then order service with make the call

        to use this service we use "spring cloud netflix eureka "
